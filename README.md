# BC Wallet Showcase

**Version:** 0.1.0  
**License:** Apache-2.0

## üìù Module Overview

The **Wallet Showcase** project bring an **Interactive Digital Credential Showcase Builder** allowing less technically inclined people to create showcases and demo scenarios with
verifiable credentials. The showcases then are automatically made available on a **Demo wallet** that can be used to run the scenario's. It serves as a tool to quickly create
demo's showing the power of verifiable credential technology in different use cases.

### üí° Purpose

- Easily create demo's for different use cases of Verifiable Credentials.
- Allow experimentation and rapid setup for people new to Verifiable Credential technology.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionalities

- **Showcase Builder:** An Interactive User Interface to build showcases containing personas, scenarios and steps, as well as creating credential definitions, without the need of
  much technical knowledge.
- **Demo Wallet:** The Demo wallet acts as the Issuer and Relying party frontend, showing the showcases, personas, scenarios and steps. This is what an end-user will see after
  showcases have been created by the Showcase builder.
- **Showcase API** The Showcase API is a REST API that serves as the technology neutral data storage between different components, of which the wallet and builder are the most
  noticeable components. The API is credential technology neutral. It has no direct integrations with any credential platform/library.
- **Traction Adapter** This is an adapter that translates the neutral API into AcaPY/Traction specific credential actions. It serves is the first of potentially many different
  integrations points with future credential technologies.

### üèÜ Key Benefits
- **Easy of use:** The showcase builder is designed to be used by less technically inclined users, allowing them to experiment with different showcases
- **Rapid prototyping:** The showcase builder allows you to rapidly create an entire new showcase, or add new scenarios to existing showcases. This allows for rapid experimentation and customization
- **Multi-tenant:** The showcase builder, API and wallet are designed as multi-tenant solutions, allowing to make the tool available to different departments, or even external customers
- **Flexibility:** Adapters can be swapped or extended to support different credential formats (e.g., SD-JWT, OID4VCI) and wallets in the future.
- **Resilience:** Durable messaging to handle temporary outages without data loss.

## üì¶ Package Management

This project uses **pnpm** and **turbo** for monorepo and package management.

## Running 

### Copy env files
For each of the apps under the apps/ directory, you'll need to create a ```.env``` file from the corresponding ```.env.example``` template. This ensures all environment variables are set up correctly before running the applications.

```bash
cp apps/bc-wallet-api-server/.env.example apps/bc-wallet-api-server/.env
cp apps/bc-wallet-demo-server/.env.example apps/bc-wallet-demo-server/.env
cp apps/bc-wallet-demo-web/.env.example apps/bc-wallet-demo-web/.env
cp apps/bc-wallet-showcase-creator/.env.example apps/bc-wallet-showcase-creator/.env
cp apps/bc-wallet-traction-adapter/.env.example apps/bc-wallet-traction-adapter/.env
```


Additionally, for the Docker development environment, copy the Docker env file:

```bash
cp docker/dev/.env.example docker/dev/.env
```

>üìå Important: After copying, review each .env file (including docker/dev/.env) and update the values as needed to match your local setup or deployment environment.

### üê≥ Option 1 - Docker

>These steps assume that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.

>‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your .env files are properly copied from docker/dev/.env.example 


You can run all apps using Docker. 


```bash
docker compose up -d
```
This will build and start all services in detached mode.

To stop and remove all running containers and associated volumes, run:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

### Option 2 - Native

### Make sure pnpm is installed

```shell
npm -g install pnpm
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### Generate Modals

```bash
pnpm generate:models
```

## Start Required Services with Docker

>These steps assume that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.

Before running the applications, ensure that PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ are up and running. You can start each service separately using Docker:

### Start PostgreSQL

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
```

### Start RabbitMQ

```bash
docker compose up -d rabbitmq
```

### Start the Project

```bash
pnpm dev
```

#### Run Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```


#### Create a Tenant for Showcase Builder

After starting all services and the project is running, you'll need to create a tenant in order to use the Showcase Builder.

üìò For detailed instructions, please refer to the [README](./apps/bc-wallet-api-server/README.md) file 


#### üöÄ Local Development URLs

After starting the apps, you can access them at the following local addresses:

#### Showcase Creator Access

Access the Showcase Creator using the following URL format:

```bash
http://localhost:5003/en/<tenant-id>/login
```

For example, if your tenant ID is showcase-tenantA, the URL would be:

```bash
http://localhost:5003/en/showcase-tenantA/login
```

- API Server: http://localhost:5005

- Demo Web: http://localhost:5002/digital-trust/showcase


### Build the Project

```bash
pnpm build
```

For CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
pnpm test:ci
```
